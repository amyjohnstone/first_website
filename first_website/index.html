  <h1>Cool Space Facts</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This website is aimed at an audience with an interest in learning about what exactly is in the night sky.
    Someone who watched Neil deGrasse Tyson’s ‘COSMOS: A Spacetime Odyssey and thought <i>Ooh that looks cool</i> but didn’t pursue a career in
    astrophysics because they realised how much maths was involved. This website is for you. </p>
      <p>Cool Space Facts delivers the basics of astronomy. Our aim is to educate adults in an interesting way. We hope you enjoy using this website
       as much as we enjoyed creating it!</p>
